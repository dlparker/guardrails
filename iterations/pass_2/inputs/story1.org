** Story Name: GnuCash finder experiement

 *Story goal: Review UI methods of identifying and loading GnuCash file*

Using the extend the textual base UI stub found in scripts/tx_main.py
and src/ctrack/textual/tx_main.py, experiment with methods of
selecting a GnuCash file to target with the application. This selection would
be the first step in creating an app based on the flow defined in src/ctrack/flow.py,
review tests/test_flow.py to understand the relevance of selecting and loading the GnuCash
file.

Keep in mindthat the underlying DataService mechanism only supports a single
GnuCash target file so trying to load a new one may require some sort
of reset of the database, probably by removing it an re-initializing
the DataService.

Options to try are:

1.  The built in DirectoryTree - doesn't do file picker directly, but should be good base for implementing one
2.  textual-fspicker
3.  textual-filedrop


*** Here are some Task sketches, actual task definitions my need more information:

Task 1:
Common Task Fields:
| Name              | Value                      |
| parent story id   | 1                          |
| parent story name | GnuCash finder experiement |
| task id           | 1                          |
| task name         | try DirectoryTree picker   |
| task type         | spike code                 |

Write example file picker UI elements in textual using the DirectoryTree function targeting the example gnuchcash
file that is found in demo_work after running "uv run scripts/prep_work.py". Do some kind of basic validation of
successful load by printing the output of one of the src/ctrack/data_service.py query operations.

Task 2:
Common Task Fields:
| Name              | Value                      |

| parent story name | GnuCash finder experiement |
| task id           | 2                          |
| task name         | try textual-fspicker       |
| task type         | spike code                 |

Write example file picker UI elements in textual using the textual-fspicker library targeting the example gnuchcash
file that is found in demo_work after running "uv run scripts/prep_work.py". Do some kind of basic validation of
successful load by printing the output of one of the src/ctrack/data_service.py query operations.
