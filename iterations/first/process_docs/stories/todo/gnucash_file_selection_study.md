# Story Defintion

# Generic

## Phase \'Exploring\'

During the exploring phase both human and agentic developers should:

1.  Treat output as likely disposable, so no effort to create foundation for future work
2.  Treat goal definition as definitive, avoid imagining additional requirements.
3.  Minimize the volume and complexity of the output so that project lead can easily assimilate.
4.  Absolutely avoid adding error handling, retries, optional API elements, etc. unless specified in the story or task.

## Story Type \'Study\'

This is a \"Study Story\", a process artifact similar to a User Story but focused on answering questions about problem space and possible solution options. Any artifacts produced in this story are expected to be ephemeral and tuned to the purpose of informing the lead developer as to leasons learned. Any code produced should be considered disposable, this being what many call a \"spike\".

Once this story is marked complete, a report should be generated by examining the git history of changes made during the work on this story, and by querying the lead developer. The report should summarize the experiments that were done, and the analysis of which solution methods, if any, the lead developer decided to retain as models for future work. It should also contain any observations that the lead developer supplies about why any choices were rejected, and about any issues that the lead developer has identifies which reduce confidence that the retained examples will show the right path in the long run.

# Specific

## Story Name: GnuCash finder experiement

Experiement with UI methods of identifying and loading GnuCash file

Using the UI tookit that is currently being explored, experiment with methods of selecting a GnuCash file to target with the applicati
on. Keep in mind that the underlying DataService mechanism only supports a single GnuCash target file so trying to load a new one may require some sort of reset of the database, probably by removing it an re-initializing the DataService.

****Task Breakdown****

The first artifact that will be produced in this story period is a set of tasks. These will be written markdown files placed in the directory process~docs~/tasks/pending. They will contain, at minimum:

1.  The name of the story that the task belongs too, and the pathname of the story definition file
2.  The name of the task
3.  A description of how the task applies to the story\'s goals.
4.  A description of the expected artifacts. e.g. a test script that prints \"foo\", or a summary analysis of options, etc.
5.  The name of the \"role\" of actor that performs this task, serves as a guide for how the actor should think about it.
6.  The name of the \"mode\" of activity for this task, serves as guide for what actions are likely appropriate.
7.  The name of the \"phase\" of activity for this task, the same phase as the story itself
8.  A git hash of the state of the repo when the task started
9.  A placeholder for a git hash of the state of the repo when the task completed
10. A placeholder for a save/discard decision from the lead developer
11. An optional placeholder for the name of a different task if the results of one was chosen for retention in preference to this one.

Options to try, should be at least one task for each of these, might need more:

1.  The built in DirectoryTree - doesn\'t do file picker directly, but should be good base for implementing one
2.  textual-fspicker
3.  textual-filedrop
