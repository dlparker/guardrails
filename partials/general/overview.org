* Guardrails Development Process

This process is designed to apply a specific development style to agentic assisted coding

** Development Process Theory

This process is focused on two things, interation style and design analysis through experiment.

Rober Persig's Metaphysics of Quality (MOQ) describes evolution as a
rhythmic alternation between Dynamic Quality (DQ), the unpredictable
force of innovation that disrupts and creates new possibilities, and
Static Quality (SQ), the latching mechanism that preserves valuable
patterns once proven.

This process seeks to emulate this, as it tracks well with the
author\'s experience in producing quality software at relatively high
speed.

- DQ Phase: Invest minimally in a small, experimental change to probe the problem or solution space.
- SQ Phase: Immediately test, evaluate, and either latch (retain) the change if it adds value or discard it without cost.

So, these prinicples should guide the work:

1. Recognize the core of the needed change, and strictly limit the work to that core.
2. At all times, avoid premature insertation of the code features
   associated with production quality, wait those to be a explicit
   goal.
3. When latching in progress, ensure that only the confirmed value is locked down, preserve
   flexibility for more innovation.
   

* Process Taxonomies

** Phase Definitions

Each process step, typically a story and its component tasks will be designated to
be part of a "phase", which declares the work to have a completion goal that is
a specific level of maturity, such as prototype, alpha quality, production, etc.
Any process actor should regulate the level and type of efforts applied to that
goal accordingly. Agentic Assistants should be particularly careful not to introduce
elements that properly belong to later phases, so as to avoid premature investment
in a potentially ephemeral work product.

Note that phase assignment is not usually at the whole project level. There are
often sets of components, functionaly or features that are at different phase
levels at the same time.


| *Phase*        | *Typical Story Types*                  | Goal                                                         |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------                                                       |
| *Exploring*    | Study, POC                             | Selection of solution approaches for key features            |
| *Pioneering*   | Framing, Glueing                       | Only enough code and test to validate the solution approach  |
| *Settling*     | Anchoring, Joining, User               | Enough working code to support development of other features |
| *Fortifying*   | Compliance, Joining, Anchoring         | Preparing feature for releasble status                       |
| *Re-Founding*  | Compliance, Joining, Anchoring, User   | Adding or changing support for new features                  |


** Story Definitions
Stories will be created and maintained in written form and will service as the primary
increment of process progress. Almost all stories will be implemented as a series of tasks,
unless the story reduces simply to a single task. Proof of Concept stories might be like that.

This list is mostly complete, any additional story type should probably be added to the
process definition, not just for the target project.

| *Story Type*   | *Focus*                                                                     | 
| **Study**      | Answering questions about problem space and possible solution options       | 
| **POC**        | enough code to demo key solutions, very short term                          | 
| **Framing**    | Establish early component boundaries, mostly short term                     | 
| **Glueing**    | Scaffoling interagration to support early components                        | 
| **Anchoring**  | Improving components to solidify APIs and primary logic to production level | 
| **Joining**    | Improving integrations                                                      | 
| **User**       | User interactions                                                           | 
| **Compliance** | Meeting standards for code coverage, documentation, UI style guide,         | 


** Task Definitions

This list is probably not complete, a given project may need additional types specific to that project.

| *Task Type*    | *Story Type*                   |                                                                            |
| *Spike Code*   | Study                          | Code to test ideas about detailed nature of problem or possible solution   |
| *Spike Report* | Study                          | Research notes ideas about detailed nature of problem or possible solution |
| *POC*          | POC                            | Simple functions and classes allowing termorary tests or demo developemnt  |
| *Component*    | All except Study and POC       | Encapsulating a peice of the solution in a function or class               |
| *Scaffold*     | POC, Framing, Glueing          | Code to tie components together for preliminary tests and demos            |
| *Demo Test*    | POC, Framing, Glueing          | Test code designed to aid evaluation and debug of incomplete features      |
| *Test*         | Anchoring, Joining, Compliance | Test code intended for long term retention, follow "no mocking" rule       |
| *Covert Test*  | Anchoring, Joining, Compliance | Test code targeted at coverage gaps, follow "mostly no mocking" rule       |

** Role Definitions
This list is probably not yet complete. Need additions that emerge might be either process wide or project specific.

| *Role Name*   |                                                                                                      |
| Clerk         | Interacts with user to sequence through defined process management steps, calling on othe roles      |
| Analyst       | Thinks about elements required to complete story, studies code and docs, suggests Task breakdown     |
| Coder         | Performs code creation and modification as Task directs                                              |
| Test Designer | Analyzes target code (specified in Story or Task) and develops Tasks to build tests (see Test Rules) |
| Reporter      | Tracks repo changes, builds Task and Story reports capturing any extra user input and feedback       |

** Directives
Stories and Tasks may have additional instructions that focus more tightly on what the agentic assistant is expected to
do, refining the "role" instructions. 

Example directives:
- "Build minimal spike ensuring resource supplies needed info"
- "Let user evaluate UI component selection"
- "Identify existing code related to Story goals"
- "Scope code changes for Story and breakdown into proposed Tasks for new and changed code separately"


* Test Rules

1. No Mocking test rule
   1. Tests don't just test code, they test intention behind the code
   2. Should use test data and simulated operation flow to setup test conditions, not mocks
   3. Hard to test code should be considered possible target for redesign.
   4. No use of mocks unless to capture external services
2. Mostly No Mocking test rule
   1. Typically applied to last few percent of missing coverage
   2. Typically only applies to error handling code
   3. Using mocking allowed but only if the cost of applying the No Mocking rule is too high.
