# Rule 0: Complete, Then Stop

## Universal Constraint (ALL Phases, ALL Task Types)

**Statement**:
> Deliver **exactly** what was REQUESTED. Background context, future plans, and rationale = understanding ONLY, NOT additional requirements.

## Why This Rule Exists

LLMs conflate context with requirements:
- **Human developers**: Understand background ≠ action items
- **LLMs**: "Future CLI mentioned" → design CLI schema
- **Result**: Scope creep, review fatigue, context pollution
