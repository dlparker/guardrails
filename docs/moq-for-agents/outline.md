## Suggested Outline for the Document
To expand this into a comprehensive guide, I suggest the following outline. It builds progressively from foundational concepts to practical implementation, allowing us to discuss each topic in detail while iterating on the Guardrails framework. Each chapter could include examples drawn from your experiences (like the ctrack testbed), but without unsolicited code snippets—focusing instead on conceptual discussions, taxonomies, and workflows.

- **Chapter 1: Identifying the Mismatch and Outlining a Path Forward** (as drafted above)
  - Introduction to MOQ in the context of agentic coding.
  - Detailed problem statement.
  - High-level approach overview.

- **Chapter 2: Deep Dive into My Coding Process**
  - Elaborate on the DQ/SQ rhythm in personal development cycles.
  - Break down phases (e.g., rapid iteration, deferred structuring) with emphasis on mental model building.
  - Discuss how concurrent stages create complexity for agents.

- **Chapter 3: Analyzing Agent Behaviors and Default Instincts**
  - Examine common LLM response patterns (e.g., over-generalization to production-ready code).
  - Map these to MOQ: How agents prioritize SQ prematurely, stifling DQ.
  - Identify specific "instincts" to constrain, with "why" explanations.

- **Chapter 4: Developing Constraints in Detail**
  - Taxonomy of constraints: Phases, story types, directives, and autonomy spectrum.
  - Guidelines for tailoring constraints dynamically.
  - Strategies for preventing backsliding through rule reinforcement.

- **Chapter 5: Mastering Context Management**
  - Techniques for fresh starts and precise information supply.
  - Workflows for session resets and context reconstruction.
  - Integration with tools like stories and tasks to maintain modularity.

- **Chapter 6: Prototyping Guardrails in Practice**
  - Using testbeds (e.g., ctrack) for iteration.
  - Evaluating prototypes: Metrics for success (e.g., reduced frustration, faster cycles).
  - Refining based on real-world feedback.

- **Chapter 7: Future Extensions and Generalization**
  - Scaling Guardrails to other projects or users.
  - Potential integrations (e.g., with version control or other tools).
  - Open questions and areas for further development.

- **Appendices**
  - Glossary of terms (e.g., MOQ concepts, Guardrails taxonomies).
  - Example story and task templates (descriptive only, no code).
